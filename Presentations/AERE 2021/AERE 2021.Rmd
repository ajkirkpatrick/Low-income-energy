# Energy Insecurity

## Energy Insecurity
> The disproportionate share of household income allocated to energy expenses with those that exceed a 10% threshold categorized as experiencing "energy insecurity." (HernÃ¡ndez 2015)

- Drehobl and Ross (2016) find 75th percentile energy burdens above 26%.
- Lyubich (2020) finds minority households spend more on energy
- Doremus et al (2021) finds low-income households use more energy during weather extremes

--

## Energy Inequity

- Reames (2016): Minority-dominated census block-groups tend to have lower (worse) energy efficiency and spend a greater total amount **for the same level of energy services relative to non-minority households**.

- Drehobl and Ross (2016) using ACS data: Black and Hispanic households face higher median energy burdens, even conditional on income.

--

> **Energy Inequity**: "The disproportionate incidence of energy insecurity in heavily-minority areas
relative to non-minority areas of similar income."

# Energy Insecurity

## Why?

- Preferences & Sorting?

  - Lower-efficiency homes are less expensive, income constraints $\rightarrow$ "coming to the nuisance" (Banzhaf, 2011)
  - But conditional on income, do minority households prefer lower efficiency?
  - Lower utility of heating? Lower utility of non-energy consumption?
--


- Current housing discrimination or heterogeneous information?

  - Christensen et al (2020): Rental agents steer minority households away from low-toxic exposure properties
  - Missing information disproportionately affects those sorting to the lower quality homes (Bakkensen and Ma, 2020; Hausman and Stolper, 2020)
--

- State dependence / hysteresis

  - Historic forms of discrimination
  - Frictions in moving costs

# Research Question

#### Energy Inequity is in part the result of a *hysteresis* effect rooted in historic housing discrimination.
Redlining was a "critical juncture" that separated otherwise similar housing stock. Redlining acted as a Schelling "focal point" for *de facto* discrimination.

- Test by examining differences in home energy services quality, measured as the .orange[*presence of sufficient heating technology*] and .orange[*energy consumption responses to cold weather shocks*], between current redlined and observably similar households.
  - Controlling for historic and current small neighborhood characteristics

--

#### Future research
- Lending discrimination debatably ended with CRA in 1977. Households able to migrate, re-sort.
- Test for "stickiness" of neighborhood. 
  - High non-market moving costs. 
  - Neighborhood support, family proximity, etc.

# Prior literature

### Prior literature
- Hoffman et al (2020) urban heat islands and redlined areas
- Aaronson et al (2020) examined credit availability in redlined areas over 1930-1980 with RD-based analysis
- Nardone et al (2019) asthma and redlined areas

### Enlightening and incredibly inconvenient:
Fishback, La Voice, Shertzer, and Walsh (2020) on **endogeneity of redlining designation.**
- Used linked 1930 census address data and HOLC maps to show that redlined areas captured pre-existing economic and racial discontinuities in space.
- Border discontinuities not smooth in unobserveds. Even large moves in boundaries would still capture pre-existing segregations.
- Hillier (2003) no widespread proof that HOLC maps were distributed and used.

# Analysis

### Empirical strategy
Acknowledging Fishback et al (2020), control for selection on observables:
- Presence of minorities
- Repair and quality of housing
- Rent and income (historic and current)

.orange[Assume: conditional on observables that determined selection, Grade D (red) is as good as randomly assigned]
- Unobserved neighborhood characteristics in 1930's are no longer relevant today.

### Identification of effect of redlining using observably similar HOLC neighborhoods
- Multiple surveyors result in nearly arbitrary designation of Grade D (red) and Grade C (yellow) when "subversive minorities" were present.
- Many Grade C (yellow) areas had more Blacks and worse home repair and trend than nearby Grade D (red).
- Drawback: leaning on linear controls.
  - Solution: very flexible with linear controls.
