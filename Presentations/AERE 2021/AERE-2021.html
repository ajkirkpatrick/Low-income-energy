# Energy Insecurity

## Energy Insecurity
&gt; The disproportionate share of household income allocated to energy expenses with those that exceed a 10% threshold categorized as experiencing "energy insecurity." (Hern√°ndez 2015)

- Drehobl and Ross (2016) find 75th percentile energy burdens above 26%.
- Lyubich (2020) finds minority households spend more on energy
- Doremus et al (2021) finds low-income households use more energy during weather extremes

--

## Energy Inequity

- Reames (2016): Minority-dominated census block-groups tend to have lower (worse) energy efficiency and spend a greater total amount **for the same level of energy services relative to non-minority households**.

- Drehobl and Ross (2016) using ACS data: Black and Hispanic households face higher median energy burdens, even conditional on income.

--

&gt; **Energy Inequity**: "The disproportionate incidence of energy insecurity in heavily-minority areas
relative to non-minority areas of similar income."

---
class: MSU
# Energy Insecurity

## Why?

- Preferences &amp; Sorting?

  - Lower-efficiency homes are less expensive, income constraints `\(\rightarrow\)` "coming to the nuisance" (Banzhaf, 2011)
  - But conditional on income, do minority households prefer lower efficiency?
  - Lower utility of heating? Lower utility of non-energy consumption?
--


- Current housing discrimination or heterogeneous information?

  - Christensen et al (2020): Rental agents steer minority households away from low-toxic exposure properties
  - Missing information disproportionately affects those sorting to the lower quality homes (Bakkensen and Ma, 2020; Hausman and Stolper, 2020)
--

- State dependence / hysteresis

  - Historic forms of discrimination
  - Frictions in moving costs

# Research Question

### Energy Inequity is in part the result of a *hysteresis* effect rooted in historic housing discrimination.
Redlining was a "critical juncture" that separated otherwise similar housing stock.

- Test by examining differences in home energy services quality between redlined and observably similar households, measured as the 
  - (1) .orange[*presence of sufficient heating technology*] and 
  - (2) .orange[*energy consumption responses to cold weather shocks*]
  - Controlling for historic and current small neighborhood characteristics

--

#### Not addressed here
- Lending discrimination debatably ended with CRA in 1977. Households able to migrate, re-sort. Why does Energy Inequity persist?
- Test for "stickiness" of neighborhood. 
  - High non-market moving costs. 
  - Neighborhood support, family proximity, etc.
  
#### Historic data `\(\rightarrow\)` many assumptions

# Prior literature

### Prior literature
- Hoffman et al (2020) urban heat islands and redlined areas
- Nardone et al (2019) asthma and redlined areas
- Aaronson et al (2020) examined credit availability in redlined areas over 1930-1980 with RD-based analysis

### Enlightening and incredibly inconvenient:
Fishback, La Voice, Shertzer, and Walsh (2020) on **endogeneity of redlining designation.**
- Used linked 1930 census address data and HOLC maps to show that redlined areas captured pre-existing economic and racial discontinuities in space.
- Border discontinuities not smooth in unobserveds. Even large moves in boundaries would still capture pre-existing segregations.
- Hillier (2003) no widespread proof that HOLC maps were distributed and used.

# Analysis

### Empirical strategy
Acknowledging Fishback et al (2020), I control for selection on observables:
- Rent and income (historic and current)
- Presence of minorities in 193X
- Repair and quality of housing in 193X


.orange[Assume: conditional on observables that determined selection, Grade D (red) is as good as randomly assigned]
  - Unobserved neighborhood characteristics in 1930's not captured by observables are no longer relevant today.
 
 
### Identification of effect of redlining using observably similar HOLC neighborhoods
- Multiple surveyors result in nearly arbitrary designation of Grade D (red) and Grade C (yellow) when "subversive minorities" were present.
- Many Grade C (yellow) areas had larger Black populations or worse home repair than nearby Grade D (red).
--

- Drawback: leaning on linear controls.
  - Solution: very flexible with linear controls.

# Analysis


#### (1) Presence of sufficient heating technology
- Ask "are there differences in heating sources between redlined and near-redlined homes, controlling for selection on observables?"
- Substandard heating technology = Coal or "None"
- Requires spatially explicit heating fuel use


#### (2)  Energy consumption responses to cold weather shocks
- Ask "are there differences in energy consumption responses to weather shocks between redlined and near-redlined homes, controlling for selection on observables?"
- Data on monthly consumption and heating degree days for households in Grade D / Grade C areas
- Requires spatially explicit household electricity consumption with income

  - Daytime thermostat setpoint

# Analysis: Substandard Heating Tech.

### Flexible fixed effect specification
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
`$$PercentSubstandard_{b} = \beta_0 + \sum_{g\in \{A,B,D\}} \beta_{g}^{Grade} +  \beta \mathbf{x}_b + \Gamma_{c(b)} + \gamma_{c(b)} \mathbf{w_b} + \epsilon_{b}$$`

.pull-left[
- `\(PercentSubstandard\)` is share of 2018 homes with coal or no heating fuel in block-group `\(b\)`
- `\(\beta_g\)` is coefficient of interest
- `\(\mathbf{x_b}\)` is repair class, presence of Blacks in 1936 
]

.pull-right[
- `\(\Gamma_{c(b)}\)` are county FEs for county `\(c\)`
- `\(\gamma_{c(b)}\)` are county-specific slope shifters
- `\(\mathbf{w_b}\)`
  - Median income in 1936, 2018
  - Mean rent 1935
  - Presence of Blacks in 1936

# Analysis: Hh Counsumption

### Response to temperature shocks
Home may have insufficient energy service quality if energy consumption responses to weather shocks are very large.
--

- Response is endogenous: both homes with efficient heating **and** inefficient homes who meet budget constraints with conservative thermostat settings have low consumption responses to weather shocks.
  - Observationally equivalent without observing thermostat setpoint.

# Analysis: Hh Consumption

`$$\small \begin{align}
consumption_{ht} &amp;= \beta_0 + \beta_1 HDD_{ht}  + \sum_{g \in \{A,B,D\}}\beta_g  \cdot HDD_{ht} \cdot \mathbb{1}(g=g(h)) \\
&amp;+ \sum_{l=1}^3 \sum_{s=1}^5  \beta_{ls} HDD_{ht} \cdot \mathbb{1}(NIGHTSET_h=s) \cdot \mathbb{1}(ClimateZone_h = l) + \\
&amp;+ \beta_{inc} \cdot HDD_{ht} \cdot avgincome_h + \Gamma_h + \varepsilon_{ht}
\end{align}$$`
.pull-left[
- `\(consumption_{ht}\)` is energy (kWh, therms) consumption for household `\(h\)` month `\(t\)`
- `\(g(h)\)` is HOLC Grade `\(g\)` for `\(h\)`
- `\(HDD_{ht}\)` is the heating-degree day for `\(h\)` in month `\(t\)` 
]

.pull-right[
- `\(NIGHTSET_h\)` is the thermostat setting for `\(h\)`
- `\(ClimateZone_h\)` is the climate type for `\(h\)`
- `\(income_h\)` is reported income for `\(h\)`
- `\(\Gamma_h\)` is household `\(h\)` fixed effect

# Conclusion

#### Evidence of lingering differences in heating technology in/out of redlined areas
- Remains after controlling for observable differences in 193X
- Useful for targeting of energy efficiency programs


#### Evidence of larger consumption responses to cold weather shocks in redlined areas
- Conditional on 193X observables
- Conditional on thermostat setpoints


#### Further work
- Understanding selection into Grade D (red)
- "Stickiness" of redlined areas
