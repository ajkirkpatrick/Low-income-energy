@article{Baxter1998,
abstract = {This paper discusses the implications of restructuring the U.S. electricity industry for low-income energy policy and low-income households. The paper discusses the historical development of existing low-income energy policies and programs. Federal policy has focused primarily on addressing the heating needs of low-income customers. State policy has traditionally vested the vertically integrated utility with much of the responsibility to provide energy programs to low-income customers. The paper considers how industry restructuring may affect the appropriateness of these policies and programs. The paper describes new policies to provide low-income electricity services that could be developed in parallel with broader industry restructuring efforts. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.
